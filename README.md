# Derek Drill's React web portfolio

This is the repository for the front end source code for my web portfolio. The main purpose of this project is to modernize my legacy portfolio.

This app is heavily dependent on React JS, while also relying on the following libraries and technologies to enhace code and UI capabilities:

<ul>
  <li>Material UI</li>
  <li>Styled Components</li>
  <li>React Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Font Awesome</li>
</ul>

This application is currently comprised of 24 total components that are thoughtfully created to handle the many states a user may experience throughout the app.
This initiative is still in progress, but this repository can be downloaded locally, and then 'npm start' can be run from the terminal to fire up this app in its current state

Here is the breakdown of completed and pending work on this app:
