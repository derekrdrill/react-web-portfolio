          Hi, I'm Derek. I'm just a guy from a small town in Maryland, 
        who now resides in the beautiful city of Charlotte.
        I remember falling in love with writing code, in an Intro to VB.Net class
        at Salisbury University. It all clicked for me. I was building the cheesiest
        'Movie Night' WinForms app you've ever seen, and it all 
        just started to make sense. I felt this fiery sensation
        inside as I built feature after feature, and solved problem after problem.
        The rush was addictive, and for someone who's always valued themself in working hard,
        solving problems and helping others, this was the high for me. I knew I wanted
        this to be my career.

          After undergrad, I accepted a role as a level 1 programmer,
        working for a small IT team, assigned to maintaining 
        and building onto their ERP software. This was very much an introduction
        to what it was like to be a professional developer, and was perfect
        for me to organically build a strong foundation of development principles.
        However, I knew I had to continue to sharpen my skills in my freetime.
        Through continual education, I continued to advance my skills
        in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap and SQL,
        but also teaching myself more modern technologies and libraries, such as,
        React JS, Node.js,  and MongoDB. I've carried those hard-working
        values that I enstilled early on through my career, and strive to constantly improve. 
        5 years in amd I am a Software Engineer specializing in building apps with the MERN stack, 
        which I display throughout this portfolio. Along with anything displayed here,
        I have also accomplished things like:
