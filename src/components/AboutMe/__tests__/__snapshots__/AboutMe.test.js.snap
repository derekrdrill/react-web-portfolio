          Hi, I'm Derek. I'm just a guy from a small town in Maryland, 
        who now resides in the beautiful city of Charlotte.
        I remember falling in love with writing code, in an Intro to VB.Net class
        at Salisbury University. It all clicked for me. I was building the cheesiest
        'Movie Night' WinForms app you've ever seen, and it all 
        just started to make sense. I felt this fiery sensation
        inside as I built feature after feature, and solved problem after problem.
        The rush was addictive, and for someone who's always valued themself in working hard,
        solving problems and helping others, this was the high for me. I knew I wanted
        this to be my career.

          After undergrad, I accepted a role as a level 1 programmer,
        working for a very small IT team, assigned to maintaining 
        and building onto their ERP software. This was very much an introduction
        to what it was like to be a professional developer, and was perfect
        for me to organically build a strong foundation of development principles.
        However, I knew I had to continue to sharpen my skills in my freetime.
        By taking online course after course, I continued to advance my skills
        in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap and SQL,
        but also teaching myself more modern technologies and libraries, such as,
        Knockout.js, Node.js, React JS and MongoDB. I've carried those hard-working
        values, that I enstilled early on, through my career. 5 years in, and I am now
        a Front End Developer, and have accomplished things like:

            - Worked with clients at academic offices
        of education institutions to completely 
        automate their paper-processes by building
        workflows that comprised of powerful 
        web forms that integrated with their live ERP data

            - Heavily contributed towards the development of 
        a CDN library of reusable Knockout.js components
        that made the development of powerful web forms

          The last bullet is my current role, a Front End developer
        for the IMPLAN Group, and even after several years of hard work and continual education
        to get to this point, I continue to push the limits of my knowledge daily, in and out of the office, 
        to continue to grow as a professional front end developer

          I love to write code because it fulfills the burning desire within me
        to work hard and solve intricate problems for others, and as an admitted nerd who 
        is not the most artistic, it's the best avenue to flexing my creativity muscles üí™üèº
