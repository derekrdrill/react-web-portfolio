        who now resides in the beautiful city of Charlotte.
        I remember falling in love with writing code, in an Intro to VB.Net class
        at Salisbury University. It all clicked for me. I was building the cheesiest
        'Movie Night' WinForms app you've ever seen, and it all 
        just started to make sense. I felt this fiery sensation

        By taking online course after course, I continued to advance my skills
        in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap and SQL,
        but also teaching myself more modern technologies and libraries, such as,
        Knockout.js, Node.js, React JS and MongoDB. I've carried those hard-working
        values, that I enstilled early on, through my career. 5 years in, and I am now
